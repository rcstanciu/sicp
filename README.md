# SICP Roadmap

## Foreword
Looking for a next step in developing and raising my programming/computer science/engineering skills, 
I've stumbled upon *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* by *Harold Abelson* and *Gerald Jay Sussman*.
Others describe it as a masterpiece on basics of computer science and software engineering, that promises to get you to
a deeper level of understanding of the magic of computer programming.

I'm looking forward to covering the entire book, and all of it's exercises, by the end of 2025.

## Goals
My goals for 2025, regarding SICP, are:
- Read *SICP* book, cover to cover (available [here](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html));
- Watch *MIT 6.001* video lectures (available [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/));  
- Solve all exercises from the book;
- Write about my progress, on each chapter, covering the resources read, videos watched, exercises solved, tools used.

## Inspiration
I've been inspired by other people, like [@ivanjovanovic](https://github.com/ivanjovanovic/sicp) and [@abrantesasf](https://github.com/abrantesasf/sicp-abrantes-study-guide),
that have been keeping journals like this. I take this opportunity to thank them and hope that, by writing this, I will be able to give back and help others
on their journey of development.
